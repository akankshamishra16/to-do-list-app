# to-do-list-app
A simple and user-friendly to-do list app for adding, deleting, and managing daily tasks.
A fully functional To-Do app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features include adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting them. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and event handling.

A simple task-tracking application where users can create, manage, and remove tasks. Built to practice frontend development fundamentals and JavaScript logic.
